# EGO-SORT-JS

This is a javascript port of my [ego-sort](https://github.com/ulville/ego-sort) program which basically does the same job (gets the downloads-wise ranking of my GNOME Extension from the gnome extensions website) but faster and with a cool ðŸ˜Ž web frontend gui.

## Tech used:
 - Node.js
 - Express.js
 - Axios
